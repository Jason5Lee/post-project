# Post Backend

Backend of the post project.

* [API Document](./api-document)
* [Service implementations](./services)
* [Integration test script](./integration-test)

Some of the services are implemented based on [the Domain Modeling idea from Scott Wlaschin](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) with some of my own ideas. This development method is documented [here](mdm.md).
