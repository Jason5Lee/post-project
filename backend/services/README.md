# Backend Services

- [post-rust-actix-web-fdm](post-rust-actix-web-fdm): the implementation using actix-web and sqlx.

## What you shouldn't learn from this project

- Authorization. I use a simple token mechanism. It is not secure.
- REST API design. I tried my best, but it may not fitted all the best practices.
- SQL database operation. I don't use ORM in some projects.
